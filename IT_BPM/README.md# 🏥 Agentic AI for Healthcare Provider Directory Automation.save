## ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement

This project focuses on improving provider data accuracy, reducing manual verification efforts, and streamlining healthcare provider directory management for healthcare payers.

Current workflow challenges:

- Provider directories contain 40â€“80% inaccurate contact information.
- Manual verification is labor-intensive and requires calling hundreds of providers.
- Multiple data entry points lead to inconsistencies across directories, apps, and printed materials.
- Credential verification delays provider onboarding, impacting member satisfaction.
- Regulatory compliance demands frequent updates with minimal automation.

The solution uses **Agentic AI** to orchestrate multiple Worker Agents:

- **Data Validation Agent:** Automatically validates provider contact information via web scraping and public APIs.
- **Information Enrichment Agent:** Collects additional data on providers such as certifications, specialties, and network affiliations.
- **Quality Assurance Agent:** Detects inconsistencies, flags potential errors, and assigns confidence scores.
- **Directory Management Agent:** Updates the directory across multiple formats, prioritizes human review, and generates reports.
- **Master Agent:** Coordinates all Worker Agents and provides actionable dashboards for stakeholders.

Goal: Automate provider data validation, enrichment, and quality assurance while maintaining compliance and scalability.
