## ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement

A large-scale Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) with a nationwide presence offers a range of loan products, including personal, home, and auto loans. To enhance revenue from existing customers, the NBFC aims to implement a web-based chatbot interface for personal loan sales. This chatbot will function as a digital sales assistant, with a Master Agent orchestrating multiple Worker AI agents to manage the entire loan sales processâ€”from initial conversation and verification to credit evaluation, approval, and sanction letter generation.
