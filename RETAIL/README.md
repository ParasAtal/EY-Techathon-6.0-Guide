## ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement

This project focuses on improving customer engagement, inventory management, and personalized recommendations for a retail business with multiple outlets and online presence.  

The current workflow has several pain points:

- Customer interactions are fragmented across channels (in-store, web, app).  
- Inventory is not dynamically adjusted based on real-time sales and demand patterns.  
- Product recommendations are generic and not personalized.  
- Manual coordination is required for promotions, offers, and loyalty programs.  

The solution uses **Agentic AI** to orchestrate multiple Worker Agents:

- **Customer Engagement Agent** interacts with customers via chat or voice to provide personalized offers and recommendations.  
- **Inventory Analysis Agent** monitors sales trends and predicts stock requirements to optimize replenishment.  
- **Promotion & Pricing Agent** dynamically adjusts offers, discounts, and loyalty rewards based on customer behavior and inventory levels.  
- **Master Agent** coordinates all Worker Agents, ensures compliance, and provides actionable dashboards for store managers.

The goal is to automate intelligent customer engagement, dynamic inventory control, and personalized promotions while ensuring scalability and security.
